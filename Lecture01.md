###What is this class all about?
  
  Why am I here?

###Prerequisites
  You must be a strong object-oriented programmer.

###iOS Overview
What’s in iOS?
  
###Show me!
 
A demo with a thousand words is worth tens of thousands of words. 


#What will I learn in this course?
###How to build cool apps
  Easy to build even very complex applications.
  
  Result lives in your pocket or backpack!
  
  Very easy to distribute your application through the AppStore.
  
  Vibrant development community.
  
### Real-life Object-Oriented Programming
  The heart of Cocoa Touch is 100% object-oriented.
  
  Application of MVC design model.
  
  Many computer science concepts applied in a commercial development platform:
    Databases, Graphics, Multimedia, Multithreading, Animation, Networking, and much, much more!
    
  Numerous students have gone on to sell products on the AppStore.
  


#Prerequisites
### Prior Coursework

  Object-Oriented Programming experience mandatory.
  
  CS106A&B (or X) required & CS107 or CS108 or CS110 also (at a minimum) required.
  (or equivalent for non-Stanford undergrads)
  
### You should know well the meaning of these terms …

  Class (description/template for an object)
  
  Instance (manifestation of a class)
  
  Message (sent to object to make it act)
  
  Method (code invoked by a Message)
  
  Instance Variable (object-specific storage)
  
  Superclass/Subclass (Inheritance)
  
  If you are not very comfortable with all of these, this is probably not the class for you!
  
###Programming Experience
  This is an upper-level CS course.
  
  If you have never written a program where you had to design and implement more than a handful of classes, this will be a          big step up in difficulty for you.

#Demo
###Calculator
All this stuff can be very abstract until you see it in action.

We’ll start getting comfortable with Swift and Xcode 6 by building something right away.

Two part demo starting today, finishing on Wednesday.

###Today’s topics in the demo …

- Creating a Project in Xcode 6
- Building a UI (and making it squishable/stretchable using Autolayout)
- The iOS Simulator
- println (and conversion to a String using \() notation)
- Defining a class in Swift, including how to specify instance variables and methods
- Connecting properties (instance variables) from our Swift code to the UI (outlets)
- Connecting UI elements to invoke methods in our Swift code (actions)
- Accessing iOS documentation from our code
- Optionals (?, unwrapping implicitly by declaring with !, and unwrapping explicitly with ! and if let)
